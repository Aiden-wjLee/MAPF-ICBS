## Multi-Agent Path Finding - Improved Conflict Based Search ##

Improved CBS (ICBS) is an extension of the Conflict Based Search algorithm developed for the purpose of finding optimal paths for multiple agents on any given map without collisions. ICBS was presented as an extention of CBS at the IJCAI-15 Conference which incorporates several previously found improvements to CBS to accumulate their benifits.[^1] The algorithm has many practical applications, especially in the field of autonomous robotics. 

### Background - CBS ###
Originally developed by a dedicated team of MAPF researchers at the AAAI Association, Conflict Based Search (CBS) is a two-level algorithm that guarentees optimal paths for each agent in a map internally represented as a graph. At the higher-level, CBS generates a constraint tree (CT) and conducts a seach on the tree based on conflicts between agents. At the lower-level, a search is conducted to find an optimal path for an agent with a set of given constraints.

CBS resolves conflicts by generating constraints for the agents involved in the collision. For any specific collision, constraints may be generated for the paths of agents involved, to prevent the collision from occuring. Each node on the CT maintains a set of constraints from any previous collisions found by its predecessors and a set of paths consistent with the current set of constraints. Given the paths, a new conflict can be chosen to be resolved with additional constraints. Therefore, each node generated in the CT aims to resolve a specific conflict found in its current set of paths until an optimal set of collision-free paths is found, concluding our search.[^2]

#### Prioritizing and Bypassing Conflits ####
When choosing a conflict to resolve, the priority in which conflicts are chosen should be determined by whether it increases the cost of the solution. A conflict *C* may be classified as a *cardinal*, *semi-cardinal* or *non-cardinal* conflict. If as a result of the conflict, the length of the paths for both agents increase, *C* is a cardinal conflict. If only one of the agent's path's increases, *C* is a semi-cardinal conflict, and if neither paths increase it is considered non-cardinal.[^1]


If the confliict *C* is not cardinal, there is a chance that the paths generated by one of the child nodes could replace the solution in the current node without needing to generate all the child nodes. If one of the child nodes can successfully avoid conflict *C* without increasing the cost of the paths or introducing more conflicts than the current node, the current conflict *C* can be *bypassed*, therefore reducing the size of the CT.[^3]
